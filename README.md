# AP Computer Science Fall Final
AP Computer Science Fall Final in 2016.
This program randomly generates living situations and declares whether people are able to pay rent or not. It was created to meet the requirements of my APCS teacher, so the program doesn't have many capabilities.

To run the program, run ResidentialDriver.java
